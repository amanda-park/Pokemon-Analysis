# Pokemon-Analysis

A compilation of various Pokemon analyses I have worked on over the years. Included in this repo are the following (all created in R):

* Scraping web data for Pokedex information using rvest
* Sentiment Analysis on above-mentioned scraped Pokedex data
* A simple Shiny app built on a combination of Pokedex and Pokemon data
* A logistic regression analysis on Pokemon combat statistics (project from grad school; includes Shiny components in deployed version)
