"6110","Cherubi","The small ball is not only filled with nutrients, it is also tasty. Starly try to peck it off."
"6111","Cherubi","It nimbly dashes about to avoid getting pecked by bird Pokémon that would love to make off with its small, nutrient-rich storage ball."
"6112","Cherubi","The deeper a Cherubi’s red, the more nutrients it has stockpiled in its body. And the sweeter and tastier its small ball!"
"6113","Cherubi","Sunlight colors it red. When the small ball is drained of nutrients and shriveled, evolution is near."
"6114","Cherubi","Once the fruit growing alongside the main body is large and plump, Cherubi will use the nutrients within to evolve. The fruit then detaches, becoming nourishment for other creatures."
"6115","Cherrim","It blooms during times of strong sunlight. It tries to make up for everything it endured as a bud."
"6116","Cherrim","It is docile as a bud, but turns cheerful when it blooms. It folds back into a bud if sunlight wanes."
"6117","Cherrim","If it senses strong sunlight, it opens its folded petals to absorb the sun’s rays with its whole body."
"6118","Cherrim","During times of strong sunlight, its bud blooms, its petals open fully, and it becomes very active."
"6119","Cherrim","It blooms during times of strong sunlight. The Pokémon tries to make up for everything it endured as a bud."
"6120","Cherrim","It is docile as a bud and turns cheerful when it blooms. It folds back into a bud if sunlight wanes."
"6121","Cherrim","Motionless, save for the occasional quiver. A rich array of Pokémon can be found gathered around it, drawn by the scent exuded from Cherrim’s folded petals."
"6122","Cherrim","As a bud, it barely moves. It sits still, placidly waiting for sunlight to appear."
"6123","Cherrim","Its folded petals are pretty tough. Bird Pokémon can peck at them all they want, and Cherrim won’t be bothered at all."
"6124","Cherrim","After absorbing plenty of sunlight, Cherrim takes this form. It’s full of energy while it’s like this, and its liveliness will go on until sundown."
"6125","Cherrim","The faint scent that emanates from its full blossom entices bug Pokémon to it."
"6126","Cherrim","Cheerfully active on sunny days. Immediately closes its petals and becomes immobile once the sun becomes hidden, however."
"6127","Shellos","Its colors and shapes differ from region to region. In the Sinnoh region, two types are confirmed."
"6128","Shellos","It lives along bodies of water. Its body shape has changed to suit its habitat."
"6129","Shellos","Beware of pushing strongly on its squishy body, as it makes a mysterious purple fluid ooze out."
"6130","Shellos","Its shape and coloration vary, depending on its habitat."
"6131","Shellos","It lives along bodies of water. Its body shape changed to suit its habitat."
"6132","Shellos","Found in abundance on seashores bordering warm waters. Shellos are unexpectedly friendly and will crawl toward any person they see. Take care not to get coated in mucus!"
"6133","Shellos","For the most part, it makes its home along the seashore. Its color and form differ according to its habitat and the quality of its food."
"6134","Shellos","Purple mucus sticks to the hands of anyone who touches it. Take care, as the substance is troublesome to wash off."
"6135","Shellos","While they normally live in the sea, they can function on land, too, until their skin dries out."
"6136","Shellos","When it senses danger, a purple liquid oozes out of it. The liquid is thought to be something like greasy sweat."
"6137","Shellos","This Pokémon’s habitat shapes its physique. According to some theories, life in warm ocean waters causes this variation to develop."
"6138","Shellos","Subjecting this Pokémon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky."
"6139","Shellos","Shellos lives in the sea and feasts on plankton. The lovelier the ocean where Shellos resides, the more vibrant its color becomes."
"6140","Shellos","The difference in color from one Shellos to another seems to be a result of their diet. No large changes can be seen in their capabilities."
"6141","Shellos","When it senses danger, it gushes a purple liquid. Some theories suggest this liquid is a greasy sweat induced by stress."
"6142","Shellos","Scientists interested in its great regenerative capabilities are currently analyzing the materials from which its cells are made."
"6143","Shellos","There’s speculation that its appearance is determined by what it eats, but the truth remains elusive."
"6144","Shellos","Its appearance changes depending on the environment. One theory suggests that living in cold seas causes Shellos to take on this form."
"6145","Shellos","Found in abundance on seashores bordering cold waters. When pressed upon, the Pokémon will secrete from its body’s surface a purple fluid that will stain one’s clothes."
"6146","Shellos","A recently published research paper states that this form of Shellos is gradually decreasing in number."
"6147","Shellos","This Pokémon can often be seen along seashores. It’s capable of spending a limited amount of time on land."
"6148","Shellos","It used to have a shell on its back long ago. This species is closely related to Pokémon like Shellder."
"6149","Shellos","It oozes a purple fluid to deter enemies. Apparently, there are more West Sea Shellos now than there were in the past."
"6150","Gastrodon","It has a pliable body without any bones. If any part of its body is torn off, it grows right back."
"6151","Gastrodon","It apparently had a huge shell for protection in ancient times. It lives in shallow tidal pools."
"6152","Gastrodon","Long ago, its entire back was shielded with a sturdy shell. There are traces of it left in its cells."
"6153","Gastrodon","When its natural enemy attacks, it oozes purple fluid and escapes."
"6154","Gastrodon","Eats beach sand for nourishment. Should one Gastrodon encounter another of a different color, a fierce battle will inevitably ensue."
"6155","Gastrodon","It has strong regenerative capabilities. Even if parts of it are bitten off by fish Pokémon, it will return to normal within a few hours."
"6156","Gastrodon","Plankton, invisible to the naked eye, is its main food source. It comes onto the land periodically, but the reason for this is not known."
"6157","Gastrodon","Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There’s now a vestigial plate on its back that’s hard but thin."
"6158","Gastrodon","Their shape and color change, depending on their environment and diet. There are many of them at beaches where the waves are calm."
"6159","Gastrodon","Its search for food sometimes leads it onto land, where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it passes through."
"6160","Gastrodon","The softness of its body helps disperse the force of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly squishy, it’s also surprisingly resilient."
"6161","Gastrodon","A team of researchers is scouring the oceans of the world in search of a Gastrodon in a color never seen before."
"6162","Gastrodon","Experiments are being conducted to discover what happens when a Gastrodon is raised in a location other than the sea where it was born."
"6163","Gastrodon","When it’s attacked, it gushes a purple liquid that’s not poisonous but makes Gastrodon’s meat bitter and inedible."
"6164","Gastrodon","A relative of Shellder and Cloyster, this ocean dweller sometimes comes onto land in search of food."
"6165","Gastrodon","It secretes a purple fluid to deter enemies. This fluid isn’t poisonous—instead, it’s super sticky, and once it sticks, it’s very hard to unstick."
"6166","Gastrodon","Its body is covered in a sticky slime. It’s very susceptible to dehydration, so it can’t spend too much time on land."
"6167","Gastrodon","Found more often on the land than in the sea. More active when it’s cloudy or rainy out than when the weather is fair."
"6168","Gastrodon","They normally inhabit rocky seashores, but in times of continuous rain, they can sometimes be found in the mountains, far from the sea."
"6169","Gastrodon","Fishers say that they didn’t see many of these Pokémon in the past, but this form of Gastrodon is now increasing in number."
"6170","Gastrodon","Its whole body is sticky with mucus. In the past, this form of Gastrodon was by far the more numerous one."
"6171","Gastrodon","It appears on beaches where the waters are shallow. Once it catches prey, it will slowly melt them with its mucus before slurping them up."
"6172","Ambipom","To eat, it deftly shucks nuts with its two tails. It rarely uses its arms now."
"6173","Ambipom","They work in large colonies and make rings by linking their tails, apparently in friendship."
"6174","Ambipom","Split into two, the tails are so adept at handling and doing things, AMBIPOM rarely uses its hands."
"6175","Ambipom","They live on large trees. They are said to communicate by connecting their tails to those of others."
"6176","Ambipom","It is very difficult to dodge the consecutive strikes of its two tails."
"6177","Ambipom","Split into two, the tails are so adept at handling and doing things, Ambipom rarely uses its hands."
"6178","Ambipom","In their search for comfortable trees, they get into territorial disputes with groups of Passimian. They win about half the time."
"6179","Ambipom","It uses its tails for everything. If it wraps both of its tails around you and gives you a squeeze, that’s proof it really likes you."
"6180","Ambipom","To affirm their kinship, members of this species will form a ring by linking their newly doubled tails together. On rare occasions, humans have been accepted into such rings."
"6181","Drifloon","A Pokémon formed by the spirits of people and Pokémon. It loves damp, humid seasons."
"6182","Drifloon","It tugs on the hands of children to steal them away. However, it gets pulled around instead."
"6183","Drifloon","Because of the way it floats aimlessly, an old folktale calls it a “Signpost for Wandering Spirits.”"
"6184","Drifloon","It is whispered that any child who mistakes DRIFLOON for a balloon and holds on to it could wind up missing."
"6185","Drifloon","These Pokémon are called the “Signpost for Wandering Spirits.” Children holding them sometimes vanish."
"6186","Drifloon","Stories go that it grabs the hands of small children and drags them away to the afterlife. It dislikes heavy children."
"6187","Drifloon","If for some reason its body bursts, its soul spills out with a screaming sound."
"6188","Drifloon","Its round body is stuffed with souls and expands each time it leads someone away."
"6189","Drifloon","Wandering souls gathered together to form this Pokémon. When trying to make friends with children, Drifloon grabs them by the hand."
"6190","Drifloon","Perhaps seeking company, it approaches children. However, it often quickly runs away again when the children play too roughly with it."
"6191","Drifloon","The gathering of many souls gave rise to this Pokémon. During humid seasons, they seem to appear in abundance."
"6192","Drifloon","It is a Pokémon formed by the spirits of people and Pokémon. It loves damp, humid seasons."
"6193","Drifloon","It tugs on the hands of children to spirit them away. However, it gets pulled around instead."
"6194","Drifloon","Said to lure away young children and carry them off to the afterlife. Some whisper that Drifloon are formed of reincarnated human souls, but these rumors are as yet unconfirmed."
"6195","Drifloon","It is whispered that any child who mistakes Drifloon for a balloon and holds on to it could wind up missing."
"6196","Drifloon","Because of the way it floats aimlessly, an old folktale calls it a “signpost for wandering spirits.”"
"6197","Drifblim","It’s drowzy in daytime, but flies off in the evening in big groups. No one knows where they go."
"6198","Drifblim","It carries people and Pokémon when it flies. But since it only drifts, it can end up anywhere."
"6199","Drifblim","At dusk, swarms of them are carried aloft on winds. When noticed, they suddenly vanish."
"6200","Drifblim","It can generate and release gas within its body. That’s how it can control the altitude of its drift."
"6201","Drifblim","They carry people and Pokémon, but the wind can catch them, so there can’t be a fixed destination."
"6202","Drifblim","It’s drowsy in daytime, but flies off in the evening in big groups. No one knows where they go."
"6203","Drifblim","There was once an incident in which a man took a trip riding a Drifblim, only to go missing."
"6204","Drifblim","Even while under careful observation, large flocks of Drifblim flying at dusk will inexplicably disappear from view."
"6205","Drifblim","There’s a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim floating on the wind at dusk, you’ll be carried away to the afterlife."
"6206","Drifblim","The raw material for the gas inside its body is souls. When its body starts to deflate, it’s thought to carry away people and Pokémon."
"6207","Drifblim","Some say this Pokémon is a collection of souls burdened with regrets, silently drifting through the dusk."
"6208","Drifblim","It grabs people and Pokémon and carries them off somewhere. Where do they go? Nobody knows."
"6209","Drifblim","They’re drowsy in daytime but fly off in the evening in big groups. No one knows where they go."
"6210","Drifblim","It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy aspect touches some people deeply—every so often, one will come upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim."
"6211","Buneary","It slams foes by sharply uncoiling its rolled ears. It stings enough to make a grown-up cry in pain."
"6212","Buneary","When it senses danger, it perks up its ears. On cold nights, it sleeps with its head tucked into its fur."
"6213","Buneary","Its ears are always rolled up. They can be forcefully extended to shatter even a large boulder."
"6214","Buneary","You can tell how it feels by the way it rolls its ears. When it’s scared, both ears are rolled up."
"6215","Buneary","By extending its rolled-up ears and striking the ground, it can bound so high it surprises itself."
"6216","Buneary","Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its ears up tight and then unleashes them with its full force, it can smash boulders to dust."
"6217","Buneary","The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it can launch a swift counterattack if it’s attacked by an enemy."
"6218","Buneary","If both of Buneary’s ears are rolled up, something is wrong with its body or mind. It’s a sure sign the Pokémon is in need of care."
"6219","Buneary","Buneary can attack by rolling up their ears and then striking with the force created by unrolling them. This attack becomes stronger with training."
"6220","Buneary","My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its hearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokémon protects its hearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears."
"6221","Lopunny","An extremely cautious Pokémon. It cloaks its body with its fluffy ear fur when it senses danger."
"6222","Lopunny","It is very conscious of its looks and never fails to groom its ears. It runs with sprightly jumps."

"6230","Lopunny","An extremely cautious Pokémon that cloaks its body with its fluffy ear fur when it senses danger."
"6231","Lopunny","It likes to keep itself clean and never fails to groom its ears. It runs with sprightly jumps."
"6232","Lopunny","Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokémon kicks as though it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents with ease."
"6233","Lopunny","It swings its ears like whips and strikes its enemies with them. It has an intensely combative disposition."
"6234","Lopunny","Mega Evolution awakens its combative instincts. It has shed any fur that got in the way of its attacks."
"6235","Mismagius","Its cries sound like incantations. Those hearing it are tormented by headaches and hallucinations."
"6236","Mismagius","It chants incantations. While they usually torment targets, some chants bring happiness."
"6237","Mismagius","Its cry sounds like an incantation. It is said the cry may rarely be imbued with happiness-giving power."
"6238","Mismagius","Its cries sound like incantations to torment the foe. It appears where you least expect it."
"6239","Mismagius","It appears as if from nowhere—muttering incantations, placing curses, and giving people terrifying visions."
"6240","Mismagius","Mismagius have been known to cast spells to make people fall in love, so some people search for this Pokémon as if their life depended on it."
"6241","Mismagius","Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads, this Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells that help people."
"6242","Mismagius","Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches or terrifying visions that torment others."
"6243","Mismagius","Its cries sound like incantations. Those who hear it are tormented by headaches and hallucinations."
"6244","Mismagius","It chants incantations. While these incantations can torment targets, some bring happiness."
"6245","Mismagius","The incantations Mismagius chants can ward against misfortune, so a custom exists of inviting it into one’s home. Incur the Pokémon’s displeasure, however, and disaster will surely ensue."
"6246","Honchkrow","Becoming active at night, it is known to swarm with numerous MURKROW in tow."
"6247","Honchkrow","It makes its MURKROW cronies bring it food. It idles its time away, grooming itself in its nest."

"6253","Honchkrow","If its Murkrow cronies fail to catch food for it, or if it feels they have betrayed it, it will hunt them down wherever they are and punish them."
"6254","Honchkrow","It will absolutely not forgive failure from or betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this if it wants to maintain the order of the flock."
"6255","Honchkrow","Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it. The only time it dirties its own hands is in delivering a final blow to finish off an opponent."
"6256","Honchkrow","Becoming active at night, it is known to form flocks with numerous Murkrow in tow."
"6257","Honchkrow","It makes its Murkrow cronies bring it food. It idles its time away, grooming itself in its nest."
"6258","Honchkrow","One cry from this Pokémon, and a murder of Murkrow come flying. At such times, one would think the curtain of night had fallen, plunging the world into jet-black darkness."
"6259","Honchkrow","It is merciless by nature. It is said that it never forgives the mistakes of its Murkrow followers."
"6260","Honchkrow","A single cry from this nocturnal Pokémon, and more than 100 of its Murkrow cronies will assemble."

"6270","Purugly","It would claim another Pokémon’s nest as its own if it finds a nest sufficiently comfortable."
"6271","Purugly","To make itself appear intimidatingly beefy, it tightly cinches its waist with its split tail."
"6272","Purugly","Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great popularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses even velveteen."
"6273","Chingling","It emits cries by agitating an orb at the back of its throat. It moves with flouncing hops."
"6274","Chingling","Each time it hops, it makes a ringing sound. It deafens foes by emitting high-frequency cries."
"6275","Chingling","There is an orb inside its mouth. When it hops, the orb bounces all over and makes a ringing sound."
"6276","Chingling","It emits high-frequency cries that  people can’t hear. Once it starts, it can cry for an awfully long time."
"6277","Chingling","This Pokémon gave me an excruciating headache when it seemingly cried out without making a sound. Perhaps there are some sounds that the human ear is simply incapable of hearing."

"6285","Skuntank","It sprays a vile-smelling fluid from the tip of its tail to attack. Its range is over 160 feet."
"6286","Skuntank","It sprays a stinky fluid from its tail. The fluid smells worse the longer it is allowed to fester."

"6298","Bronzor","They are found in ancient tombs. The patterns on their backs are said to be imbued with mysterious power."
"6299","Bronzor","Ancient people believed that the pattern on Bronzor’s back contained a mysterious power."
"6300","Bronzor","It appears in ancient ruins. The pattern on its body doesn’t come from any culture in the Galar region, so it remains shrouded in mystery."
"6301","Bronzor","Polishing Bronzor to a shine makes its surface reflect the truth, according to common lore. Be that as it may, Bronzor hates being polished."
"6302","Bronzor","Implements shaped like Bronzor were discovered in ancient tombs. It is unknown whether they are related."
"6303","Bronzor","X-ray photos were taken to check its body structure, but nothing was seen."
"6304","Bronzor","Floats using a mysterious energy. The pattern engraved upon its back is held as sacred and can sometimes be found in imagery from ancient cemeteries and other such timeworn places."

"6317","Bonsly","It prefers an arid atmosphere. It leaks water that looks like tears when adjusting its moisture level."
"6318","Bonsly","In order to adjust the level of fluids in its body, it exudes water from its eyes. This makes it appear to be crying."
"6319","Bonsly","It does not deal well with water, so it lives in dry locales. Since its surroundings tend to lack greenery, it stands out noticeably."
"6320","Bonsly","From its eyes, it can expel excess moisture from its body. This liquid is similar in composition to human sweat."
"6321","Bonsly","It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it look like it’s crying—apparently an effective way of getting enemies to let down their guard."
"6322","Bonsly","If its body gets too damp, it will die. So, in a process reminiscent of sweating, its eyes expel moisture."
"6323","Bonsly","It expels both sweat and tears from its eyes. The sweat is a little salty, while the tears have a slight bitterness."
"6324","Bonsly","This Pokémon lives in dry, rocky areas. As its green spheres dry out, their dull luster increases."
"6325","Bonsly","Its tears elicit sympathy from those who see them, but do not be deceived! This expulsion of body water is merely a physiological mechanism for keeping itself in good health."

"6328","Mime Jr.","It mimics the expressions and motions of those it sees to understand the feelings of others."

"6330","Mime Jr.","It does its absolute best to mimic the movements and expressions of its opponents, but it’s still not very good at it."
"6331","Mime Jr.","When this gifted mimic surprises an opponent, Mime Jr. feels so happy that it ends up forgetting it was imitating something."
"6332","Mime Jr.","It mimics everyone it sees, but it puts extra effort into copying the graceful dance steps of Mr. Rime as practice."
"6333","Mime Jr.","It looks for a Mr. Rime that’s a good dancer and carefully copies the Mr. Rime’s steps like an apprentice."
"6334","Mime Jr.","It habitually mimics foes. The mimicked foe is said to be unable to look away from Mime Jr."

"7014","Woobat","Suction from its nostrils enables it to stick to cave walls during sleep. It leaves a heart-shaped mark behind."
"7015","Woobat","The heart-shaped mark left on a body after a Woobat has been attached to it is said to bring good fortune."
"7016","Woobat","While inside a cave, if you look up and see lots of heart-shaped marks lining the walls, it’s evidence that Woobat live there."

"7019","Swoobat","Anyone who comes into contact with the ultrasonic waves emitted by a courting male experiences a positive mood shift."
"7020","Swoobat","It shakes its tail vigorously when it emits ultrasonic waves strong enough to reduce concrete to rubble."
"7021","Swoobat","Emitting powerful sound waves tires it out. Afterward, it won’t be able to fly for a little while."
"7022","Swoobat","The auspicious shape of this Pokémon’s nose apparently led some regions to consider Swoobat a symbol of good luck."

"7035","Audino","Using the feelers on its ears, it can tell how someone is feeling or when an egg might hatch."
"7036","Audino","Audino’s sense of hearing is superb. Not even a pebble rolling along over a mile away will escape Audino’s ears."

"7045","Gurdurr","With strengthened bodies, they skillfully wield steel beams to take down buildings."
"7046","Gurdurr","It shows off its muscles to Machoke and other Gurdurr. If it fails to measure up to the other Pokémon, it lies low for a little while."
"7047","Gurdurr","Gurdurr excels at demolition—construction is not its forte. In any case, there’s skill in the way this Pokémon wields its metal beam."
"7048","Conkeldurr","It is thought that Conkeldurr taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago."
"7049","Conkeldurr","They use concrete pillars as walking canes. They know moves that enable them to swing the pillars freely in battle."
"7050","Conkeldurr","Rather than rely on force, they master moves that utilize the centrifugal force of spinning concrete."
"7051","Conkeldurr","Concrete mixed by Conkeldurr is much more durable than normal concrete, even when the compositions of the two materials are the same."

"7059","Palpitoad","It lives in the water and on land. It uses its long, sticky tongue to capture prey."

"7072","Throh","They train in groups of five. Any member that can’t keep up will discard its belt and leave the group."
"7073","Sawk","The sound of Sawk punching boulders and trees can be heard all the way from the mountains where they train."
"7074","Sawk","Tying their belts gets them pumped and makes their punches more destructive. Disturbing their training angers them."
"7075","Sawk","Desiring the strongest karate chop, they seclude themselves in mountains and train without sleeping."
"7076","Sawk","If you see a Sawk training in the mountains in its single-minded pursuit of strength, it’s best to quietly pass by."
"7077","Sawk","The karate chops of a Sawk that’s trained itself to the limit can cleave the ocean itself."
"7078","Sewaddle","Leavanny dress it in clothes they made for it when it hatched. It hides its head in its hood while it is sleeping."
"7079","Sewaddle","This Pokémon makes clothes for itself. It chews up leaves and sews them with sticky thread extruded from its mouth."
"7080","Sewaddle","Since this Pokémon makes its own clothes out of leaves, it is a popular mascot for fashion designers."

"7092","Whirlipede","Protected by a hard shell, it spins its body like a wheel and crashes furiously into its enemies."
"7093","Whirlipede","It is usually motionless, but when attacked, it rotates at high speed and then crashes into its opponent."

"7102","Cottonee","When attacked, it escapes by shooting cotton from its body. The cotton serves as a decoy to distract the attacker."
"7103","Cottonee","They go wherever the wind takes them. On rainy days, their bodies are heavier, so they take shelter beneath big trees."
"7104","Cottonee","Perhaps because they feel more at ease in a group, they stick to others they find. They end up looking like a cloud."
"7105","Cottonee","When it finds others of its kind, they all stick together. When enough of them have collected, the mass resembles a cumulonimbus cloud."
"7106","Cottonee","Pillows and beds stuffed with cotton exhaled by Cottonee are soft and puffy, light and airy— altogether top quality."
"7107","Cottonee","To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body. When it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows moist and heavy, and it can’t move as well."

"7125","Petilil","Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly."
"7126","Petilil","They prefer clean water and soil. When the environment they live in turns bad, the whole bunch will up and move to a new area."
"7127","Petilil","Petilil appears around sources of clean water. Boiling leaves from this Pokémon’s head results in a liquid that’s sometimes used as a bug repellent."
"7128","Petilil","The deeper the color of a Petilil’s leaves, the healthier the Pokémon is. Petilil sometimes makes its home in a well-tended field or flowerbed."
"7129","Petilil","The leaves on its head are highly valued for medicinal purposes. Dry the leaves in the sun, boil them, and then drink the bitter decoction for remarkably effective relief from fatigue."
"7130","Petilil","If the leaves on its head are pruned with regularity, this Pokémon can be grown into a fine plump shape."
"7131","Lilligant","Even veteran Trainers face a challenge in getting its beautiful flower to bloom. This Pokémon is popular with celebrities."

"7133","Lilligant","The fragrance of the garland on its head has a relaxing effect, but taking care of it is very difficult."
"7134","Lilligant","No matter how much time and money is spent raising it, its flowers are the most beautiful when they bloom in the wild."
"7135","Lilligant","As soon as it finds a male to be its partner, the beautiful flower on its head darkens, droops, and withers away."
"7136","Lilligant","The fragrance of its flower differs slightly depending on the soil where it grew up. Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind."
"7137","Lilligant","It’s well liked by other Pokémon because of its beauty. The flower on its head needs constant care, or it will soon wither and rot."
"7138","Lilligant","It’s believed that even first-rate gardeners have a hard time getting the flower on a Lilligant’s head to bloom."
"7139","Lilligant","Essential oils made from Lilligant flowers have a sublime scent, but they’re also staggeringly expensive."
"7140","Lilligant","I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes from its flower crown heartens those in proximity."
"7141","Basculin","Red and blue Basculin get along so poorly, they’ll start fighting instantly. These Pokémon are very hostile."
"7142","Basculin","Red and blue Basculin usually do not get along, but sometimes members of one school mingle with the other’s school."

"7150","Basculin","Even Basculin, which devours everything it can with its huge jaws, is nothing more than food to organisms stronger than itself."
"7151","Basculin","Some people call it “the thug of the lake.” Whether the differences in color are meaningful is not yet known."
"7152","Basculin","Blue-striped Basculin used to be a common food source. They apparently have an inoffensive, light flavor."
"7153","Basculin","Known for their violence, these Pokémon have the most fights with schools of red-striped Basculin."
"7154","Basculin","These Pokémon form schools with others of the same color. The greatest foe of a school of blue Basculin is a school of red Basculin."
"7155","Basculin","The power of its jaws is immense—enough to leave teeth marks in iron sheets. Its personality is also extremely vicious."
"7156","Basculin","Though it differs from other Basculin in several respects, including demeanor—this one is gentle—I have categorized it as a regional form given the vast array of shared qualities."
"7157","Sandile","They live buried in the sands of the desert. The sun-warmed sands prevent their body temperature from dropping."

"7162","Sandile","Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts."
"7163","Sandile","Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”"
"7164","Sandile","The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun sets, this Pokémon burrows deep into the sand and sleeps until sunrise."
"7165","Sandile","Sandile is small, but its legs and lower body are powerful. Pushing sand aside as it goes, Sandile moves through the desert as if it’s swimming."

"7210","Dwebble","It makes a hole in a suitable rock. If that rock breaks, the Pokémon remains agitated until it locates a replacement."
"7211","Dwebble","When it finds a stone of a suitable size, it secretes a liquid from its mouth to open up a hole to crawl into."
"7212","Dwebble","When it finds a stone appealing, it creates a hole inside it and uses it as its home. This Pokémon is the natural enemy of Roggenrola and Rolycoly."

"7218","Crustle","Its thick claws are its greatest weapons. They’re mighty enough to crack Rhyperior’s carapace."
"7219","Scraggy","Its skin has a rubbery elasticity, so it can reduce damage by defensively pulling its skin up to its neck."
"7220","Scraggy","It immediately headbutts anyone that makes eye contact with it. Its skull is massively thick."
"7221","Scraggy","Proud of its sturdy skull, it suddenly headbutts everything, but its weight makes it unstable, too."
"7222","Scraggy","They move in small groups, walking around lazily. Anyone who makes eye contact gets smacked with a headbutt."

"7455","Amoonguss","It lures prey close by dancing and waving its arm caps, which resemble Poké Balls, in a swaying motion."
"7456","Amoonguss","They show off their Poké Ball caps to lure prey, but very few Pokémon are fooled by this."
"7457","Amoonguss","It moves the caps on both arms and does a dance to lure prey. It prefers damp places."
"7458","Amoonguss","This Pokémon puffs poisonous spores at its foes. If the spores aren’t washed off quickly, they’ll grow into mushrooms wherever they land."
"7459","Amoonguss","Amoonguss generally doesn’t move much. It tends to stand still near Poké Balls that have been dropped on the ground."
"7460","Amoonguss","Be wary of the poisonous spores it releases. Mushrooms resembling Amoonguss’s caps will grow out of anywhere the spores touch."
"7461","Amoonguss","Amoonguss mimics Poké Balls. It is not yet clear whether this mimicry is effective against other Pokémon."
"7462","Frillish","With its thin, veil-like arms wrapped around the body of its opponent, it sinks to the ocean floor."
"7463","Frillish","They paralyze prey with poison, then drag them down to their lairs, five miles below the surface."
"7464","Frillish","If its veil-like arms stun and wrap a foe, that foe will be dragged miles below the surface, never to return."
"7465","Frillish","It wraps its veillike arms and legs around prey swimming by and drags them down to the depths of the ocean."
"7466","Frillish","Using the invisible poison spikes on its veillike arms and legs, it paralyzes its enemies and causes them to drown."
"7467","Frillish","It envelops its prey in its veillike arms and draws it down to the deeps, five miles below the ocean’s surface."
"7468","Frillish","Its thin, veillike arms have tens of thousands of poisonous stingers. Females have slightly longer stingers."
"7469","Frillish","Legend has it that the residents of a sunken ancient city changed into these Pokémon."
"7470","Jellicent","The fate of the ships and crew that wander into Jellicent’s habitat: all sunken, all lost, all vanished."
"7471","Jellicent","They propel themselves by expelling absorbed seawater from their bodies. Their favorite food is life energy."
"7472","Jellicent","Its body is mostly seawater. It’s said there’s a castle of ships Jellicent have sunk on the seafloor."
"7473","Jellicent","Jellicent is always hanging around fancy cruise ships and tankers, hoping to drag away its prey."
"7474","Jellicent","Fishermen are terrified of Jellicent. It’s rumored to drag them into the sea and steal their lives away."
"7475","Jellicent","These Pokémon have body compositions that are mostly identical to seawater. They make their lairs from sunken ships."
"7476","Jellicent","The crown on its head gets bigger and bigger as it absorbs more and more of the life-force of other creatures."
"7477","Jellicent","Most of this Pokémon’s body composition is identical to sea water. It makes sunken ships its lair."
"7478","Jellicent","Whenever a full moon hangs in the night sky, schools of Jellicent gather near the surface of the sea, waiting for their prey to appear."
"7479","Alomomola","The special membrane enveloping Alomomola has the ability to heal wounds."
"7480","Alomomola","Floating in the open sea is how they live. When they find a wounded Pokémon, they embrace it and bring it to shore."
"7481","Alomomola","It gently holds injured and weak Pokémon in its fins. Its special membrane heals their wounds."
"7482","Alomomola","It uses its special mucus to close the wounds of injured Pokémon. The reason for this behavior remains unknown."
"7483","Alomomola","They float upon the open sea. Many water Pokémon gather in the area around Alomomola."
"7484","Alomomola","Fishermen take them along on long voyages, because if you have an Alomomola with you, there’ll be no need for a doctor or medicine."
"7485","Alomomola","The reason it helps Pokémon in a weakened condition is that any Pokémon coming after them may also attack Alomomola."
"7486","Joltik","Joltik that live in cities have learned a technique for sucking electricity from the outlets in houses."
"7487","Joltik","They attach themselves to large-bodied Pokémon and absorb static electricity, which they store in an electric pouch."
"7488","Joltik","Since it can’t generate its own electricity, it sticks onto large-bodied Pokémon and absorbs static electricity."
"7489","Joltik","Joltik can be found clinging to other Pokémon. It’s soaking up static electricity because it can’t produce a charge on its own."
"7490","Joltik","Joltik latch on to other Pokémon and suck out static electricity. They’re often found sticking to Yamper’s hindquarters."
"7491","Galvantula","When attacked, they create an electric barrier by spitting out many electrically charged threads."
"7492","Galvantula","They employ an electrically charged web to trap their prey. While it is immobilized by shock, they leisurely consume it."
"7493","Galvantula","It creates barriers from electrified silk that stun foes. This works as a weapon as well as a defense."
"7494","Galvantula","It launches electrified fur from its abdomen as its means of attack. Opponents hit by the fur could be in for three full days and nights of paralysis."
"7495","Galvantula","It lays traps of electrified threads near the nests of bird Pokémon, aiming to snare chicks that are not yet good at flying."
"7496","Ferroseed","When threatened, it attacks by shooting a barrage of spikes, which gives it a chance to escape by rolling away."
"7497","Ferroseed","They stick their spikes into cave walls and absorb the minerals they find in the rock."
"7498","Ferroseed","It absorbs the iron it finds in the rock while clinging to the ceiling. It shoots spikes when in danger."
"7499","Ferroseed","It defends itself by launching spikes, but its aim isn’t very good at first. Only after a lot of practice will it improve."
"7500","Ferroseed","Mossy caves are their preferred dwellings. Enzymes contained in mosses help Ferroseed’s spikes grow big and strong."
"7501","Ferrothorn","It fights by swinging around its three spiky feelers. A hit from these steel spikes can reduce a boulder to rubble."
"7502","Ferrothorn","They attach themselves to cave ceilings, firing steel spikes at targets passing beneath them."
"7503","Ferrothorn","By swinging around its three spiky feelers and shooting spikes, it can obliterate an opponent."
"7504","Ferrothorn","This Pokémon scrapes its spikes across rocks, and then uses the tips of its feelers to absorb the nutrients it finds within the stone."
"7505","Ferrothorn","Its spikes are harder than steel. This Pokémon crawls across rock walls by stabbing the spikes on its feelers into the stone."
"7506","Klink","The two minigears that mesh together are predetermined. Each will rebound from other minigears without meshing."
"7507","Klink","Interlocking two bodies and spinning around generates the energy they need to live."
"7508","Klink","Two bodies comprise a fixed pair. They spin around each other to generate energy."
"7509","Klink","The two minigears that compose this Pokémon are closer than twins. They mesh well only with each other."
"7510","Klink","It’s suspected that Klink were the inspiration behind ancient people’s invention of the first gears."
"7511","Klang","By changing the direction in which it rotates, it communicates its feelings to others. When angry, it rotates faster."
"7512","Klang","Spinning minigears are rotated at high speed and repeatedly fired away. It is dangerous if the gears don’t return."
"7513","Klang","A minigear and big gear comprise its body. If the minigear it launches at a foe doesn’t return, it will die."
"7514","Klang","When Klang goes all out, the minigear links up perfectly with the outer part of the big gear, and this Pokémon’s rotation speed increases sharply."
"7515","Klang","Many companies in the Galar region choose Klang as their logo. This Pokémon is considered the symbol of industrial technology."
"7516","Klinklang","Its red core functions as an energy tank. It fires the charged energy through its spikes into an area."
"7517","Klinklang","The gear with the red core is rotated at high speed for a rapid energy charge."
"7518","Klinklang","The minigear spins at high speed. Then the energy from the red core charges the minigear to make it ready to fire."
"7519","Klinklang","From its spikes, it launches powerful blasts of electricity. Its red core contains an enormous amount of energy."
"7520","Klinklang","The three gears that compose this Pokémon spin at high speed. Its new spiked gear isn’t a living creature."
"7521","Tynamo","While one alone doesn’t have much power, a chain of many Tynamo can be as powerful as lightning."
"7522","Tynamo","These Pokémon move in schools. They have an electricity-generating organ, so they discharge electricity if in danger."
"7523","Tynamo","One alone can emit only a trickle of electricity, so a group of them gathers to unleash a powerful electric shock."
"7524","Eelektrik","They coil around foes and shock them with electricity-generating organs that seem simply to be circular patterns."
"7525","Eelektrik","These Pokémon have a big appetite. When they spot their prey, they attack it and paralyze it with electricity."
"7526","Eelektrik","It wraps itself around its prey and paralyzes it with electricity from the round spots on its sides. Then it chomps."
"7527","Eelektross","They crawl out of the ocean using their arms. They will attack prey on shore and immediately drag it into the ocean."
"7528","Eelektross","With their sucker mouths, they suck in prey. Then they use their fangs to shock the prey with electricity."
"7529","Eelektross","It latches on to prey with its sucker mouth, sinking in its fangs and shocking the prey with powerful electricity."
"7530","Elgyem","It uses its strong psychic power to squeeze its opponent’s brain, causing unendurable headaches."
"7531","Elgyem","This Pokémon had never been seen until it appeared from far in the desert 50 years ago."
"7532","Elgyem","Rumors of its origin are linked to a UFO crash site in the desert 50 years ago."
"7533","Elgyem","It controls tremendous psychic power. Most reports of alien sightings are actually just people mistaking Elgyem for an alien."
"7534","Elgyem","This Pokémon is shrouded in mystery. It’s said to have appeared from a UFO that fell from the sky about 50 years ago."
"7535","Elgyem","If this Pokémon stands near a TV, strange scenery will appear on the screen. That scenery is said to be from its home."
"7536","Elgyem","This Pokémon was discovered about 50 years ago. Its highly developed brain enables it to exert its psychic powers."
"7537","Beheeyem","It can manipulate an opponent’s memory. Apparently, it communicates by flashing its three different-colored fingers."
"7538","Beheeyem","It uses psychic power to control an opponent’s brain and tamper with its memories."
"7539","Beheeyem","Apparently, it communicates by flashing its three fingers, but those patterns haven’t been decoded."
"7540","Beheeyem","With its psychic powers, it rewrites its opponents’ memories. You, too, may have already had your memories rewritten."

"7542","Beheeyem","Whenever a Beheeyem visits a farm, a Dubwool mysteriously disappears."
"7543","Beheeyem","Sometimes found drifting above wheat fields, this Pokémon can control the memories of its opponents."
"7544","Litwick","Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon, which becomes the fuel that it burns."
"7545","Litwick","While shining a light and pretending to be a guide, it leeches off the life force of any who follow it."
"7546","Litwick","Its flame is usually out, but it starts shining when it absorbs life force from people or Pokémon."
"7547","Litwick","The flame on its head keeps its body slightly warm. This Pokémon takes lost children by the hand to guide them to the spirit world."
"7548","Litwick","The younger the life this Pokémon absorbs, the brighter and eerier the flame on its head burns."
"7549","Lampent","This ominous Pokémon is feared. Through cities it wanders, searching for the spirits of the fallen."
"7550","Lampent","It arrives near the moment of death and steals spirit from the body."
"7551","Lampent","The spirits it absorbs fuel its baleful fire. It hangs around hospitals waiting for people to pass on."
"7552","Lampent","This Pokémon appears just before someone passes away, so it’s feared as an emissary of death."
"7553","Lampent","It lurks in cities, pretending to be a lamp. Once it finds someone whose death is near, it will trail quietly after them."
"7554","Chandelure","It absorbs a spirit, which it then burns. By waving the flames on its arms, it puts its foes into a hypnotic trance."
"7555","Chandelure","Being consumed in Chandelure’s flame burns up the spirit, leaving the body behind."
"7556","Chandelure","The spirits burned up in its ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever."
"7557","Chandelure","This Pokémon haunts dilapidated mansions. It sways its arms to hypnotize opponents with the ominous dancing of its flames."
"7558","Chandelure","In homes illuminated by Chandelure instead of lights, funerals were a constant occurrence— or so it’s said."
"7559","Axew","They use their tusks to crush the berries they eat. Repeated regrowth makes their tusks strong and sharp."
"7560","Axew","They mark their territory by leaving gashes in trees with their tusks. If a tusk breaks, a new one grows in quickly."
"7561","Axew","Its large tusks have a tendency to break, but each time they grow back, they grow in harder and sturdier."
"7562","Axew","These Pokémon nest in the ground and use their tusks to crush hard berries. Crushing berries is also how they test each other’s strength."
"7563","Axew","They play with each other by knocking their large tusks together. Their tusks break sometimes, but they grow back so quickly that it isn’t a concern."
"7564","Axew","This Pokémon lives in nests that are made in the ground. People in ancient times used its tusks as cooking knives."
"7565","Axew","If you see peculiar teeth marks on boulders or trees, it means an Axew is likely living nearby."
"7566","Fraxure","Since a broken tusk will not grow back, they diligently sharpen their tusks on river rocks after they’ve been fighting."
"7567","Fraxure","Their tusks can shatter rocks. Territory battles between Fraxure can be intensely violent."
"7568","Fraxure","A broken tusk will not grow back, so it diligently sharpens its tusks on river rocks after the end of a battle."
"7569","Fraxure","After battle, this Pokémon carefully sharpens its tusks on river rocks. It needs to take care of its tusks—if one breaks, it will never grow back."
"7570","Fraxure","Its skin is as hard as a suit of armor. Fraxure’s favorite strategy is to tackle its opponents, stabbing them with its tusks at the same time."
"7571","Fraxure","Because its tusks don’t grow back once they break, this Pokémon apparently won’t use them unless truly necessary."
"7572","Fraxure","Fraxure uses its thick tusks to neatly cut prey into two portions—one to eat now and one to save for later."
"7573","Haxorus","They are kind but can be relentless when defending territory. They challenge foes with tusks that can cut steel."
"7574","Haxorus","Their sturdy tusks will stay sharp even if used to cut steel beams. These Pokémon are covered in hard armor."
"7575","Haxorus","Its tusks are incredibly destructive. They can easily slice through a thick, sturdy steel column every time."
"7576","Haxorus","Its resilient tusks are its pride and joy. It licks up dirt to take in the minerals it needs to keep its tusks in top condition."
"7577","Haxorus","While usually kindhearted, it can be terrifying if angered. Tusks that can slice through steel beams are how Haxorus deals with its adversaries."
"7578","Haxorus","This Pokémon nests in caves and abandoned mines. It is docile, but it will become incredibly angry if its tusks are touched, so beware."
"7579","Haxorus","It overwhelms enemies with its prized tusks, which are sharp enough to cut through a metal transmission tower in one strike."
"7580","Cubchoo","When it is not feeling well, its mucus gets watery and the power of its Ice-type moves decreases."
"7581","Cubchoo","Its nose is always running. It sniffs the snot back up because the mucus provides the raw material for its moves."
"7582","Cubchoo","Their snot is a barometer of health. When healthy, their snot is sticky and the power of their ice moves increases."
"7583","Cubchoo","When this Pokémon is in good health, its snot becomes thicker and stickier. It will smear its snot on anyone it doesn’t like."
"7584","Cubchoo","It sniffles before performing a move, using its frosty snot to provide an icy element to any move that needs it."
"7585","Cubchoo","Many of this species can be found along the shorelines of cold regions. If a Cubchoo lacks dangling snot, there’s a chance it is sick."
"7586","Cubchoo","When Cubchoo starts sneezing, watch out! If it spatters you with its frosty snot, you’ll get frostbite."
"7587","Beartic","It can make its breath freeze at will. Very able in the water, it swims around in northern seas and catches prey."
"7588","Beartic","It freezes its breath to create fangs and claws of ice to fight with. Cold northern areas are its habitat."
"7589","Beartic","They love the cold seas of the north. They create pathways across the ocean waters by freezing their own breath."
"7590","Beartic","It swims through frigid seas, searching for prey. From its frozen breath, it forms icy fangs that are harder than steel."
"7591","Beartic","It swims energetically through frigid seas. When it gets tired, it freezes the seawater with its breath so it can rest on the ice."
"7592","Beartic","It is a ferocious, carnivorous Pokémon. Once it captures its prey, it will breathe cold air onto the prey to freeze and preserve it."
"7593","Beartic","Feared as the Snow-White Demon in northern lands, Beartic uses its frosty claws and fangs to attack prey."
"7594","Cryogonal","When its body temperature goes up, it turns into steam and vanishes. When its temperature lowers, it returns to ice."
"7595","Cryogonal","They are born in snow clouds. They use chains made of ice crystals to capture prey."
"7596","Cryogonal","They are composed of ice crystals. They capture prey with chains of ice, freezing the prey at -148° F."
"7597","Cryogonal","They are composed of ice crystals. They capture prey with chains of ice, freezing the prey at -148 degrees Fahrenheit."
"7598","Cryogonal","With its icy chains, Cryogonal freezes those it encounters. It then takes its victims away to somewhere unknown."
"7599","Cryogonal","When the weather gets hot, these Pokémon turn into water vapor. Cryogonal are almost never seen during summer."
"7600","Cryogonal","Cryogonal appear during cold seasons. It is said that people and Pokémon who die on snowy mountains are reborn into these Pokémon."
"7601","Cryogonal","Cryogonal uses its chains of ice to constrict its opponents and then flash-freezes them where they stand."
"7602","Shelmet","When attacked, it defends itself by closing the lid of its shell. It can spit a sticky, poisonous liquid."
"7603","Shelmet","It evolves when bathed in an electric-like energy along with Karrablast. The reason is still unknown."
"7604","Shelmet","When it and Karrablast are together, and both receive electrical stimulation, they both evolve."
"7605","Shelmet","When attacked, it tightly shuts the lid of its shell. This reaction fails to protect it from Karrablast, however, because they can still get into the shell."
"7606","Shelmet","It has a strange physiology that responds to electricity. When together with Karrablast, Shelmet evolves for some reason."
"7607","Accelgor","When its body dries out, it weakens. So, to prevent dehydration, it wraps itself in many layers of thin membrane."
"7608","Accelgor","Having removed its heavy shell, it becomes very light and can fight with ninja-like movements."
"7609","Accelgor","When its body dries out, it weakens. So it wraps a membrane around itself for protection while it spits poison."
"7610","Accelgor","It moves with blinding speed and lobs poison at foes. Featuring Accelgor as a main character is a surefire way to make a movie or comic popular."
"7611","Accelgor","Discarding its shell made it nimble. To keep itself from dehydrating, it wraps its body in bands of membrane."
"7612","Stunfisk","Its skin is very hard, so it is unhurt even if stepped on by sumo wrestlers. It smiles when transmitting electricity."
"7613","Stunfisk","It conceals itself in the mud of the seashore. Then it waits. When prey touch it, it delivers a jolt of electricity."
"7614","Stunfisk","When its opponent can’t be paralyzed, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away."
"7615","Stunfisk","Thanks to bacteria that lived in the mud flats with it, this Pokémon developed the organs it uses to generate electricity."
"7616","Stunfisk","For some reason, this Pokémon smiles slightly when it emits a strong electric current from the yellow markings on its body."
"7617","Stunfisk","Living in mud with a high iron content has given it a strong steel body."
"7618","Stunfisk","Its conspicuous lips lure prey in as it lies in wait in the mud. When prey gets close, Stunfisk clamps its jagged steel fins down on them."
"7619","Mienfoo","In fights, they dominate with onslaughts of flowing, continuous attacks. With their sharp claws, they cut enemies."
"7620","Mienfoo","They have mastered elegant combos. As they concentrate, their battle moves become swifter and more precise."
"7621","Mienfoo","It takes pride in the speed at which it can use moves. What it loses in power, it makes up for in quantity."

"7624","Mienfoo","In one minute, a well-trained Mienfoo can chop with its arms more than 100 times."
"7625","Mienfoo","Though small, Mienfoo’s temperament is fierce. Any creature that approaches Mienfoo carelessly will be greeted with a flurry of graceful attacks."

"7629","Mienshao","It overwhelms its opponents with continuous attacks and then slowly stores up power before delivering the finishing blow."
"7630","Mienshao","When Mienshao lets out a bizarre wail, you’re in danger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to see is about to be unleashed!"
"7631","Mienshao","When Mienshao comes across a truly challenging opponent, it will lighten itself by biting off the fur on its arms."
"7632","Mienshao","Delivered at blinding speeds, kicks from this Pokémon can shatter massive boulders into tiny pieces."
"7633","Druddigon","It warms its body by absorbing sunlight with its wings. When its body temperature falls, it can no longer move."

"7637","Druddigon","It infiltrates tunnels that Pokémon like Diglett and Dugtrio have dug and quietly waits for prey to pass through."
"7638","Druddigon","Druddigon lives in caves, but it never skips sunbathing—it won’t be able to move if its body gets too cold."
"7639","Druddigon","Druddigon are vicious and cunning. They take up residence in nests dug out by other Pokémon, treating the stolen nests as their own lairs."
"7640","Golett","The energy that burns inside it enables it to move, but no one has yet been able to identify this energy."
"7641","Golett","These Pokémon are thought to have been created by the science of an ancient and mysterious civilization."
"7642","Golett","Ancient science fashioned this Pokémon from clay. It’s been active for thousands of years."
"7643","Golett","Its movements are powered by a mysterious energy. It has continued to move since ancient times, so its power may soon run out."
"7644","Golett","Although ancient people apparently built it by working with clay, the source of its energy is unclear."
"7645","Golett","They were sculpted from clay in ancient times. No one knows why, but some of them are driven to continually line up boulders."
"7646","Golett","This Pokémon was created from clay. It received orders from its master many thousands of years ago, and it still follows those orders to this day."

"7652","Golurk","Artillery platforms built into the walls of ancient castles served as perches from which Golurk could fire energy beams."
"7653","Golurk","There’s a theory that inside Golurk is a perpetual motion machine that produces limitless energy, but this belief hasn’t been proven."
"7654","Pawniard","Blades comprise this Pokémon’s entire body. If battling dulls the blades, it sharpens them on stones by the river."

"7659","Pawniard","It uses river stones to maintain the cutting edges of the blades covering its body. These sharpened blades allow it to bring down opponents."
"7660","Pawniard","A pack of these Pokémon forms to serve a Bisharp boss. Each Pawniard trains diligently, dreaming of one day taking the lead."
"7661","Pawniard","Pawniard will fearlessly challenge even powerful foes. In a pinch, it will cling to opponents and pierce them with the blades all over its body."
"7662","Pawniard","Any chips in its blades would prove fatal for it. After each battle, it diligently maintains its blades using its favorite sharpening stone."

"7941","Pyroar","The temperature of its breath is over 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, but Pyroar doesn’t use it on its prey. This Pokémon prefers to eat raw meat."
"7942","Pyroar","The females of a pride work together to bring down prey. It’s thanks to them that their pride doesn’t starve."

"7989","Skiddo","If it has sunshine and water, it doesn’t need to eat, because it can generate energy from the leaves on its back."
"7990","Skiddo","Until recently, people living in the mountains would ride on the backs of these Pokémon to traverse the mountain paths."
"7991","Skiddo","As long as it has sunlight and water, Skiddo can make energy with the leaves on its body, allowing it to live on rocky mountains barren of food."
"7992","Gogoat","It can tell how its Trainer is feeling by subtle shifts in the grip on its horns. This empathic sense lets them run as if one being."
"7993","Gogoat","They inhabit mountainous regions. The leader of the herd is decided by a battle of clashing horns."
"7994","Gogoat","It can sense the feelings of others by touching them with its horns. This species has assisted people with their work since 5,000 years ago."
"7995","Gogoat","These Pokémon live in herds in mountainous places. The victor in their contests of clashing horns will become the leader of the herd."
"7996","Pancham","It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark."
"7997","Pancham","It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face, but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head."
"7998","Pancham","It grows up imitating the behavior of Pangoro, which it looks up to as a leader."
"7999","Pancham","There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside from an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous, so it’s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers."
"8000","Pancham","It follows Pangoro around like a henchman. When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away."
"8001","Pancham","It’s desperate to intimidate its opponents. Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely."
"8002","Pancham","It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey."
"8003","Pancham","Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, Pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling."

"8008","Pangoro","This rowdy Pokémon boasts great physical strength. Many Trainers are also smitten by its lively character."

"8012","Furfrou","Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes it more elegant but also increases the swiftness of its movements."
"8013","Furfrou","Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon were the designated guardians of the king."
"8014","Furfrou","There was an era when aristocrats would compete to see who could trim their Furfrou’s fur into the most exquisite style."
"8015","Furfrou","Left alone, its fur will grow longer and longer, but it will only allow someone it trusts to cut it."
"8016","Espurr","The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out."
"8017","Espurr","It has enough psychic energy to blast everything within 300 feet of itself, but it has no control over its power."
"8018","Espurr","Though Espurr’s expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power."
"8019","Espurr","There’s enough psychic power in Espurr to send a wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be controlled, Espurr finds it troublesome."
"8020","Meowstic","When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust."
"8021","Meowstic","The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense."
"8022","Meowstic","Revealing the eyelike patterns on the insides of its ears will unleash its psychic powers. It normally keeps the patterns hidden, however."
"8023","Meowstic","The defensive instinct of the males is strong. It’s when they’re protecting themselves or their partners that they unleash their full power."
"8024","Meowstic","Females are a bit more selfish and aggressive than males. If they don’t get what they want, they will torment you with their psychic abilities."
"8025","Meowstic","If it doesn’t hold back when it unleashes its psychic power, it can tear apart a tanker. Its unfriendliness is part of its charm."
"8026","Honedge","Apparently this Pokémon is born when a departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself to people and drinks their life force."
"8027","Honedge","If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps a blue cloth around that person’s arm and drains that person’s life energy completely."
"8028","Honedge","Honedge’s soul once belonged to a person who was killed a long time ago by the sword that makes up Honedge’s body."
"8029","Honedge","The blue eye on the sword’s handguard is the true body of Honedge. With its old cloth, it drains people’s lives away."
"8030","Doublade","When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons."
"8031","Doublade","The complex attack patterns of its two swords are unstoppable, even for an opponent greatly accomplished at swordplay."
"8032","Doublade","Honedge evolves into twins. The two blades rub together to emit a metallic sound that unnerves opponents."
"8033","Doublade","The two swords employ a strategy of rapidly alternating between offense and defense to bring down their prey."
"8034","Aegislash","Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon."
"8035","Aegislash","Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king."
"8036","Aegislash","In this defensive stance, Aegislash uses its steel body and a force field of spectral power to reduce the damage of any attack."
"8037","Aegislash","Its potent spectral powers allow it to manipulate others. It once used its powers to force people and Pokémon to build a kingdom to its liking."
"8038","Aegislash","This stance is dedicated to offense. It can cleave any opponent with the strength and weight of its steel blade."
"8039","Aegislash","Once upon a time, a king with an Aegislash reigned over the land. His Pokémon eventually drained him of life, and his kingdom fell with him."
"8040","Spritzee","It emits a scent that enraptures those who smell it. This fragrance changes depending on what it has eaten."
"8041","Spritzee","In the past, rather than using perfume, royal ladies carried a Spritzee that would waft a fragrance they liked."
"8042","Spritzee","A scent pouch within this Pokémon’s body allows it to create various scents. A change in its diet will alter the fragrance it produces."
"8043","Spritzee","The scent its body gives off enraptures those who smell it. Noble ladies had no shortage of love for Spritzee."
"8044","Aromatisse","It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant, and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order to gain an edge in battle."
"8045","Aromatisse","Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will have a hard time walking alongside it."
"8046","Aromatisse","The scent that constantly emits from its fur is so powerful that this Pokémon’s companions will eventually lose their sense of smell."
"8047","Aromatisse","The scents Aromatisse can produce range from sweet smells that bolster allies to foul smells that sap an opponent’s will to fight."
"8048","Swirlix","To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy."
"8049","Swirlix","Because it eats nothing but sweets, its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy."
"8050","Swirlix","It eats its own weight in sugar every day. If it doesn’t get enough sugar, it becomes incredibly grumpy."
"8051","Swirlix","The sweet smell of cotton candy perfumes Swirlix’s fluffy fur. This Pokémon spits out sticky string to tangle up its enemies."
"8052","Slurpuff","It can distinguish the faintest of scents. It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use by helping pastry chefs in their work."
"8053","Slurpuff","Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"
"8054","Slurpuff","By taking in a person’s scent, it can sniff out their mental and physical condition. It’s hoped that this skill will have many medical applications."
"8055","Slurpuff","Slurpuff’s fur contains a lot of air, making it soft to the touch and lighter than it looks."
"8056","Inkay","Opponents who stare at the flashing of the light-emitting spots on its body become dazed and lose their will to fight."
"8057","Inkay","It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body, which drains its opponent’s will to fight. It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide."
"8058","Inkay","It draws prey near with its blinking lights and then wraps them up in its long tentacles and holds them in place."
"8059","Inkay","When exchanging information with others of its kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its body in a complex rhythm."
"8060","Inkay","It spins while making its luminescent spots flash. These spots allow it to communicate with others by using different patterns of light."
"8061","Inkay","By exposing foes to the blinking of its luminescent spots, Inkay demoralizes them, and then it seizes the chance to flee."
"8062","Malamar","It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do whatever it wants."
"8063","Malamar","It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions, then wraps its tentacles around it before finishing it off with digestive fluids."
"8064","Malamar","When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an endless number of people who utilize Malamar for their nefarious deeds."
"8065","Malamar","It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are supremely sharp."

"8067","Malamar","It’s said that Malamar’s hypnotic powers played a role in certain history-changing events."
"8068","Binacle","Two Binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock."
"8069","Binacle","They stretch and then contract, yanking their rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."
"8070","Binacle","After two Binacle find a suitably sized rock, they adhere themselves to it and live together. They cooperate to gather food during high tide."
"8071","Binacle","If the two don’t work well together, both their offense and defense fall apart. Without good teamwork, they won’t survive."
"8072","Barbaracle","When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven Binacle."
"8073","Barbaracle","Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds of their own, and they will move independently. But they usually follow the head’s orders."
"8074","Barbaracle","Seven Binacle come together to form one Barbaracle. The Binacle that serves as the head gives orders to those serving as the limbs."
"8075","Barbaracle","Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat."
"8076","Skrelp","Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off."
"8077","Skrelp","It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution."
"8078","Skrelp","It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source."
"8079","Skrelp","It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found near Dhelmise."
"8080","Skrelp","It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead."
"8081","Skrelp","Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies."
"8082","Skrelp","Skrelp evades its enemies by hiding amid drifting seaweed. It eats rotten seaweed to create its poison."
"8083","Skrelp","This Pokémon is a poor swimmer. If it’s caught in a fierce storm, it will sometimes get washed far away and become unable to return to its home."
"8084","Dragalge","Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory."
"8085","Dragalge","Tales are told of ships that wander into seas where Dragalge live, never to return."
"8086","Dragalge","This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise."
"8087","Dragalge","It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey and then takes them down with a poisonous liquid strong enough to melt metal."

"8089","Dragalge","Dragalge generates dragon energy by sticking the plume on its head out above the ocean’s surface and bathing it in sunlight."
"8090","Dragalge","Using a liquid poison, Dragalge indiscriminately attacks anything that wanders into its territory. This poison can corrode the undersides of boats."
"8091","Dragalge","Since Finizen is the better swimmer, Dragalge will approach it under the cover of seaweed, then immobilize it with a poisonous attack."
"8092","Clauncher","They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol."
"8093","Clauncher","Through controlled explosions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock."
"8094","Clauncher","Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious!"
"8095","Clauncher","It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s terrible at swimming straight."
"8096","Clauncher","Clauncher’s claws can fall off during battle, but they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is popular as a delicacy in Galar."
"8097","Clauncher","By detonating gas that accumulates in its right claw, this Pokémon launches water like a bullet. This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies."
"8098","Clauncher","This Pokémon launches water by detonating gas inside its right claw. It snipes flying Pokémon."
"8099","Clauncher","Clauncher’s claws will regrow if they fall off. The meat inside the claws is edible, but it has a distinct flavor that doesn’t appeal to all tastes."
"8100","Clawitzer","Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls."
"8101","Clawitzer","By expelling water from the nozzle in the back of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots."
"8102","Clawitzer","It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron."
"8103","Clawitzer","Its right arm is packed with meat. When its pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a cooking ingredient."
"8104","Clawitzer","After using the feelers on its oversized claw to detect the location of prey, Clawitzer launches a cannonball of water at its target."
"8105","Clawitzer","Clawitzer’s right arm is a cannon that launches projectiles made of seawater. Shots from a Clawitzer’s cannon arm can sink a tanker."
"8106","Clawitzer","Clawitzer can move through the water at a speed of 60 knots by using gas inside its body to expel water from the back of its claw."
"8107","Clawitzer","The cannonballs of seawater that Clawitzer launches from its claw are powerful enough to punch through tanker hulls."
"8108","Helioptile","They make their home in deserts. They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement."
"8109","Helioptile","The frills on either side of its head have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."
"8110","Helioptile","When spread, the frills on its head act like solar panels, generating the power behind this Pokémon’s electric moves."
"8111","Helioptile","The sun powers this Pokémon’s electricity generation. Interruption of that process stresses Helioptile to the point of weakness."
"8112","Heliolisk","They flare their frills and generate energy. A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper."

"8163","Dedenne","A Dedenne’s whiskers pick up electrical waves other Dedenne send out. These Pokémon share locations of food or electricity with one another."
"8164","Dedenne","Since Dedenne can’t generate much electricity on its own, it steals electricity from outlets or other electric Pokémon."
"8165","Dedenne","It’s small and its electricity-generating organ is not fully developed, so it uses its tail to absorb electricity from people’s homes and charge itself."

"8178","Goomy","Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing."
"8179","Goomy","It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move."
"8180","Goomy","Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade."
"8181","Goomy","Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It’s considered the weakest dragon Pokémon."

"8186","Sliggoo","It drives away opponents by excreting a sticky liquid that can dissolve anything. Its eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything."

"8214","Klefki","This Pokémon is constantly collecting keys. Entrust a Klefki with important keys, and the Pokémon will protect them no matter what."

"8330","Decidueye","The air stored inside the rachises of Decidueye’s feathers insulates the Pokémon against Hisui’s extreme cold. This is firm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment."
"8331","Litten","While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its stomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery attacks, which change based on how it coughs."
"8332","Litten","It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen. Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude."
"8333","Litten","If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving it too much affection is still a no-no."
"8334","Litten","Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time comes, Litten sets its own body on fire and burns away the old fur."
"8335","Litten","It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves."
"8336","Litten","Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws. Be careful."
"8337","Torracat","At its throat, it bears a bell of fire. The bell rings brightly whenever this Pokémon spits fire."
"8338","Torracat","It boasts powerful front legs. With a single punch, it can bend an iron bar right over."
"8339","Torracat","It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer. A powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave its Trainer’s whole body covered in scratches."
"8340","Torracat","When its mane is standing on end, you can tell it’s feeling good. When it isn’t feeling well, its fur will lie down flat."
"8341","Torracat","In the midst of battle, the fire pouch on Torracat’s neck rings like a bell and produces stronger flames than usual."
"8342","Torracat","When facing a powerful enemy, Torracat’s fighting spirit gets pumped up, and its fire bell blazes hotter."
"8343","Incineroar","This Pokémon has a violent, selfish disposition. If it’s not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its Trainer’s orders with complete nonchalance."
"8344","Incineroar","After hurling ferocious punches and flinging furious kicks, it finishes opponents off by spewing fire from around its navel."
"8345","Incineroar","Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it finds beating down unworthy opponents boring. It gets motivated for stronger opponents."
"8346","Incineroar","When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames around its waist become especially intense."
"8347","Incineroar","It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit."
"8348","Incineroar","Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well."
"8349","Popplio","This Pokémon snorts body fluids from its nose, blowing balloons to smash into its foes. It’s famous for being a hard worker."

"8351","Popplio","The balloons it inflates with its nose grow larger and larger as it practices day by day."
"8352","Popplio","Popplio gets on top of its bouncy water balloons to jump higher. It’s quite the acrobatic fighter!"
"8353","Popplio","It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer force of their bursting is what deals damage."
"8354","Popplio","If Popplio want to create big, powerful balloons, they must be persistent. It takes daily practice for these Pokémon to develop their skills."
"8355","Brionne","A skillful dancer, it creates a sequence of water balloons as it dances, and briskly bombards its enemies."
"8356","Brionne","It cares deeply for its companions. When its Trainer is feeling down, it performs a cheery dance to try and help."
"8357","Brionne","It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn’t know. This hard worker practices diligently until it can learn that dance."
"8358","Brionne","It attacks by smacking its enemies with the exploding water balloons that it creates."
"8359","Brionne","As if dancing, it artfully dodges the attacks of its enemies. All the while, it’s busy forming a bunch of balloons to overwhelm its foes."
"8360","Brionne","On nights when the sea is calm, Brionne dance with one another to the singing of the Primarina that’s leading them."
"8361","Primarina","It controls its water balloons with song. The melody is learned from others of its kind and is passed down from one generation to the next."
"8362","Primarina","Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle. This Pokémon’s Trainer must prioritize the daily maintenance of its throat at all costs."
"8363","Primarina","To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes down its prey with beautiful singing and dancing."
"8364","Primarina","Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony in song."
"8365","Primarina","With its mouth, it makes sonic waves that sound like beautiful singing. It uses the sonic waves to control its water balloons."
"8366","Primarina","For Primarina, every battle’s a stage. Its singing and the dancing of its balloons will mesmerize the audience."
"8367","Pikipek","It can peck at a rate of 16 times a second to drill holes in trees. It uses the holes for food storage and for nesting."
"8368","Pikipek","This Pokémon feeds on berries, whose leftover seeds become the ammunition for the attacks it fires off from its mouth."
"8369","Pikipek","It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can get some idea of its mood or condition from the rhythm of its pecking."
"8370","Pikipek","It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times per second!"
"8371","Trumbeak","It eats berries and stores their seeds in its beak. When it encounters enemies or prey, it fires off all the seeds in a burst."
"8372","Trumbeak","By bending its beak, it can produce a variety of calls and brand itself a noisy nuisance for its neighbors."
"8373","Trumbeak","It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over a hundred different cries at will."
"8374","Trumbeak","From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise to new plants."
"8375","Toucannon","When it battles, its beak heats up. The temperature can easily exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit, causing severe burns when it hits."
"8376","Toucannon","Within its beak, its internal gas ignites, explosively launching seeds with enough power to pulverize boulders."
"8377","Toucannon","They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel."
"8378","Toucannon","Known for forming harmonious couples, this Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a good luck charm."
"8379","Yungoos","With its sharp fangs, it will bite anything. It did not originally live in Alola but was imported from another region."
"8380","Yungoos","It wanders around in a never-ending search for food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and falls asleep on the spot."
"8381","Yungoos","Its stomach takes up most of its long torso. It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to spend on its food is no laughing matter."
"8382","Yungoos","Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh living things, so it marches down streets in search of prey."
"8383","Yungoos","Its stomach fills most of its torso. It wanders the same path every day, searching for fresh food."
"8384","Yungoos","It spends its waking hours searching endlessly for food. When Yungoos is hungry, its ferocity gains a certain edge."
"8385","Gumshoos","When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently stakes out the location...but it’s always snoozing by nightfall."
"8386","Gumshoos","It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner, but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them. This Pokémon boasts incredible patience."
"8387","Gumshoos","Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this Pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge Rattata outbreak."
"8388","Gumshoos","Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of itself and pounces when it spots its favorite meal—Rattata!"
"8389","Gumshoos","Once it finds signs of prey, it will patiently stake out the location, waiting until the sun goes down."
"8390","Gumshoos","Gumshoos specializes in relentlessly tracking down prey. The simple-minded Skwovet doesn’t seem to provide Gumshoos enough challenge."
"8391","Grubbin","Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground."
"8392","Grubbin","They often gather near places frequented by electric Pokémon in order to avoid being attacked by bird Pokémon."
"8393","Grubbin","If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin."
"8394","Grubbin","It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down."
"8395","Grubbin","Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches."
"8396","Grubbin","It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."
"8397","Charjabug","Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around."
"8398","Charjabug","From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac."
"8399","Charjabug","It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!"
"8400","Charjabug","Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents."
"8401","Charjabug","While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws."
"8402","Charjabug","Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use."

"8407","Vikavolt","It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams."
"8408","Vikavolt","If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery, a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered beams of electricity."
"8409","Crabrawler","While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints."
"8410","Crabrawler","It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious."
"8411","Crabrawler","Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches."
"8412","Crabrawler","Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it."
"8413","Crabrawler","This Pokémon punches trees and eats the berries that drop down, training itself and getting food at the same time."
"8414","Crabrawler","If it loses its pincers, they’ll quickly regrow. The pincers are popular ingredients in paella since their shells produce a tasty soup stock."
"8415","Crabominable","It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur."
"8416","Crabominable","It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets."
"8417","Crabominable","It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!"
"8418","Crabominable","Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches."
"8419","Crabominable","The detached pincers of these Pokémon are delicious. Some Trainers bring Lechonk into the mountains just to search for them."
"8420","Crabominable","Though its punches are powerful, this Pokémon’s movements are sluggish. It blows icy bubbles from its mouth to immobilize its opponents."
"8421","Oricorio","It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames."

"8423","Oricorio","It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames."
"8424","Oricorio","This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon becomes fiercely angry."
"8425","Oricorio","This Pokémon is incredibly popular, possibly because its passionate dancing is a great match with the temperament of Paldean people."

"8428","Oricorio","This form of Oricorio has sipped pink nectar. It elevates its mind with the gentle steps of its dance, then unleashes its psychic energy."
"8429","Oricorio","This Oricorio has sipped bright yellow nectar. Its bright, cheerful dance melts the hearts of its enemies."

"8432","Oricorio","This Oricorio has drunk bright yellow nectar. When it sees someone looking glum, it will try to cheer them up with a dance."
"8433","Oricorio","This form of Oricorio has sipped yellow nectar. It uses nimble steps to approach opponents, then knocks them out with electric punches."
"8434","Oricorio","The energetic, cheerful dance of these Oricorio is popular with children, but the Oricorio themselves are hard to find in Paldea."

"8445","Cutiefly","It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers. Because it’s able to sense auras, it can identify which flowers are about to bloom."
"8446","Cutiefly","Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers."
"8447","Cutiefly","Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food."

"8450","Cutiefly","An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back."
"8451","Ribombee","It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many different varieties, some used as food and others used in battle."
"8452","Ribombee","Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements."
"8453","Ribombee","Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still."
"8454","Ribombee","It can predict the weather from moisture levels and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself when there are a few clear days in a row."
"8455","Ribombee","It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar. The puffs’ effects depend on the type of ingredients and how much of each one is used."
"8456","Ribombee","Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or rained on. In the cloudy Galar region, they are very seldom seen."
"8457","Rockruff","It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up."
"8458","Rockruff","This Pokémon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side."
"8459","Rockruff","As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them."

"8462","Rockruff","This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks."
"8463","Rockruff","This Pokémon is very friendly when it’s young. Its disposition becomes vicious once it matures, but it never forgets the kindness of its master."

"8466","Lycanroc","When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its Trainer."
"8467","Lycanroc","The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off."

"8487","Wishiwashi","When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies."
"8488","Wishiwashi","It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson."
"8489","Wishiwashi","They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school."
"8490","Wishiwashi","When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract others of its kind. The light from its eyes is visible almost 25 miles away."
"8491","Wishiwashi","Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents."
"8492","Wishiwashi","When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather."
"8493","Wishiwashi","Weak Wishiwashi school together to concentrate their power. Their united force makes them the demon of the sea, feared near and far."
"8494","Wishiwashi","At their appearance, even Gyarados will flee. When they team up to use Water Gun, its power exceeds that of Hydro Pump."
"8495","Wishiwashi","Wishiwashi assemble in this formation to face off against strong foes. It boasts a strength that earned it the name “demon of the sea.”"
"8496","Wishiwashi","Called “demon of the sea” by some, when Wishiwashi are injured in battle and their numbers dwindle, they become a regular school."
"8497","Wishiwashi","On their own, they’re very weak. But when Wishiwashi pool their power together in a school, they become a demon of the sea."
"8498","Wishiwashi","When facing tough opponents, they get into formation. But if they get wounded in battle, they’ll scatter and become solitary again."
"8499","Mareanie","It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles."
"8500","Mareanie","It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon."
"8501","Mareanie","They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off."
"8502","Mareanie","Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal."
"8503","Mareanie","The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin."
"8504","Mareanie","Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious."
"8505","Mareanie","This Pokémon wanders the seaside looking for food. It often gets electric shocks from broken Pincurchin spines that it tries to eat."
"8506","Mareanie","It has excellent regenerative capabilities. Legs that a Mareanie has lost have a very bitter, astringent flavor—they’re not suitable as food."

"8509","Toxapex","To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet."
"8510","Toxapex","With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable."
"8511","Toxapex","To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat."
"8512","Toxapex","Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect."
"8513","Toxapex","This Pokémon lives within a dome made by its own legs. Toxapex monitors its surroundings by sensing the flow of the tide through its spikes."
"8514","Toxapex","Toxapex gets into fierce battles with Bruxish over areas where warm ocean currents flow, but the odds are always against it."
"8515","Mudbray","The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances its grip and its powerful running gait."
"8516","Mudbray","It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition. Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire all form part of its daily routine."

"8522","Mudbray","Though a slow walker, Mudbray is plenty strong. Its pace doesn’t change even when it’s loaded with 50 times its own body weight."
"8523","Mudsdale","It spits a mud that provides resistance to both wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were often coated with it."
"8524","Mudsdale","Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks to scrap without breaking a sweat."
"8525","Mudsdale","It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud."
"8526","Mudsdale","It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load."
"8527","Mudsdale","Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick."
"8528","Mudsdale","Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep."
"8529","Mudsdale","This Pokémon has been treasured not just for its physical labor but also because it produces high-quality mud used for making pottery."
"8530","Mudsdale","Its legs are fortified with mud and harder than stone, and they can reduce a large truck to scrap with one kick."
"8531","Dewpider","It crawls onto the land in search of food. Its water bubble allows it to breathe and protects its soft head."
"8532","Dewpider","When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them."
"8533","Dewpider","When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
"8534","Dewpider","It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land."
"8535","Dewpider","It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes."

"8604","Bounsweet","When under attack, it secretes a sweet and delicious sweat. The scent only calls more enemies to it."

"8626","Comfey","It picks flowers and sticks them to its body with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts from its petals has a healing effect."
"8627","Comfey","Comfey picks flowers with its vine and decorates itself with them. For some reason, flowers won’t wither once they’re attached to a Comfey."
"8628","Comfey","These Pokémon smell very nice. All Comfey wear different flowers, so each of these Pokémon has its own individual scent."
"8629","Oranguru","Known for its extreme intelligence, this Pokémon will look down on inexperienced Trainers, so it’s best suited to veteran Trainers."

"8680","Type: Null","Due to the danger that this synthetic Pokémon may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask to restrain its power."
"8681","Type: Null","A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen."

"8703","Minior","Places where Minior fall from the night sky are few and far between, with Alola being one of the precious few."
"8704","Minior","This is its form when its shell has fallen off. The color of its core depends on the materials that made up the food it ate."
"8705","Komala","It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its movements are apparently no more than the results of it tossing and turning in its dreams."
"8706","Komala","The log it holds was given to it by its parents at birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm of a friendly Trainer."
"8707","Komala","It stays asleep from the moment it’s born. When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether."
"8708","Komala","It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet."

"8718","Togedemaru","The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods. The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as energy in its electric sac."
"8719","Togedemaru","When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily."
"8720","Togedemaru","Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it!"
"8721","Togedemaru","With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon. It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac."

"8962","Chewtle","A popular game among children is to lift up sticks that Chewtle have bitten onto to see whose Chewtle can hang on the longest."
"8963","Drednaw","With jaws that can shear through steel rods, this highly aggressive Pokémon chomps down on its unfortunate prey."
"8964","Drednaw","This Pokémon rapidly extends its retractable neck to sink its sharp fangs into distant enemies and take them down."
"8965","Drednaw","Its massive, jagged teeth can crush a boulder in a single bite. This Pokémon has an extremely vicious disposition."
"8966","Drednaw","Drednaw lurks along the shoreline. When prey come to drink water, Drednaw stretches its neck out and chomps down on them."
"8967","Drednaw","It responded to Gigantamax energy by becoming bipedal. First it comes crashing down on foes, and then it finishes them off with its massive jaws."
"8968","Drednaw","In the Galar region, there’s a tale about this Pokémon chewing up a mountain and using the rubble to stop a flood."
"8969","Yamper","This Pokémon is very popular as a herding dog in the Galar region. As it runs, it generates electricity from the base of its tail."
"8970","Yamper","This gluttonous Pokémon only assists people with their work because it wants treats. As it runs, it crackles with electricity."
"8971","Boltund","This Pokémon generates electricity and channels it into its legs to keep them going strong. Boltund can run nonstop for three full days."
"8972","Boltund","It sends electricity through its legs to boost their strength. Running at top speed, it easily breaks 50 mph."
"8973","Rolycoly","Most of its body has the same composition as coal. Fittingly, this Pokémon was first discovered in coal mines about 400 years ago."
"8974","Rolycoly","It can race around like a unicycle, even on rough, rocky terrain. Burning coal sustains it."
"8975","Rolycoly","On sunny days, Rolycoly will come out onto grassy plains and roll around. Then it will eat the grass that gets tangled in its wheel-like leg."
"8976","Rolycoly","Chunks of the surface of this Pokémon’s body that have grown old and flaked off have long been used for fuel as an alternative to coal."
"8977","Carkol","It forms coal inside its body. Coal dropped by this Pokémon once helped fuel the lives of people in the Galar region."
"8978","Carkol","By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel at over 18 mph. The temperature of the flames it breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit."
"8979","Carkol","The temperature inside its body increases when it experiences strong emotions. It rolls around frantically while spewing flames."
"8980","Carkol","Due to the coal tar created inside it, the heap of coal on Carkol’s back never falls apart, even when the Pokémon rolls around at high speeds."
"8981","Coalossal","It’s usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit."
"8982","Coalossal","While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal will burn bright red, sending off sparks that scorch the surrounding area."
"8983","Coalossal","To intimidate its opponents, Coalossal will vigorously shake its body, scattering coal from its smoldering back."
"8984","Coalossal","It’s gentle usually but fearsome when angered. With a body that burns at over 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, it crushes foes and turns them to ash."
"8985","Coalossal","Its body is a colossal stove. With Gigantamax energy stoking the fire, this Pokémon’s flame burns hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit."
"8986","Coalossal","When Galar was hit by a harsh cold wave, this Pokémon served as a giant heating stove and saved many lives."
"8987","Applin","It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it’s just an apple and nothing more."
"8988","Applin","As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple. Not only does the apple serve as its food source, but the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution."
"8989","Applin","It grows by eating the flesh of an apple. Applin uses its own body fluid to strengthen the apple’s skin and prevent it from rotting."
"8990","Applin","Applin lives inside an apple. When an Applin is separated from its apple, its body loses moisture and the Pokémon grows weak."
"8991","Flapple","It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns."
"8992","Flapple","It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a powerful acid. It can also change its shape into that of an apple."
"8993","Flapple","It flutters around while seeking an opening in the opponent’s guard, then attacks by spitting acidic liquid strong enough to melt metal."
"8994","Flapple","It uses its own body fluid to repair its apple. Strong Flapple that have won many battles have apples that are clay colored all over."
"8995","Flapple","Under the influence of Gigantamax energy, it produces much more sweet nectar, and its shape has changed to resemble a giant apple."
"8996","Flapple","If it stretches its neck, the strong aroma of its nectar pours out. The scent is so sickeningly sweet that one whiff makes other Pokémon faint."
"8997","Appletun","Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pokémon it preys on."
"8998","Appletun","Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the skin on its back is especially yummy. Children used to have it as a snack."
"8999","Appletun","It feeds mainly on sweet apples. It will also eat small bug Pokémon that are attracted by its sweet nectar."
"9000","Appletun","When some Lechonk come along to lick the sweet nectar on Appletun’s back, Appletun will spew sticky nectar at them to drive them away."
"9001","Appletun","It blasts its opponents with massive amounts of sweet, sticky nectar, drowning them under the deluge."
"9002","Appletun","Due to Gigantamax energy, this Pokémon’s nectar has thickened. The increased viscosity lets the nectar absorb more damage than before."
"9003","Silicobra","As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than 17 pounds of sand."
"9004","Silicobra","It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide."
"9005","Silicobra","Silicobra’s neck pouch, which can inflate and deflate like a balloon, gets more elastic each time Silicobra sheds its skin."
"9006","Silicobra","Silicobra’s large nostrils are specialized for spraying sand, so this Pokémon is not very good at telling apart different smells."
"9007","Sandaconda","When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened."
"9008","Sandaconda","Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sac more efficiently."
"9009","Sandaconda","It will expand its body as much as it can and then contract itself, blasting out sand with enough force to wash away a dump truck."
"9010","Sandaconda","The sand it spews contains sharp, pointy gravel, which is actually just sand that Sandaconda’s saliva has hardened into irregular shapes."
"9011","Sandaconda","Its sand pouch has grown to tremendous proportions. More than 1,000,000 tons of sand now swirl around its body."
"9012","Sandaconda","Sand swirls around its body with such speed and power that it could pulverize a skyscraper."
"9013","Cramorant","It’s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it’s battling midfight."
"9014","Cramorant","This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole. Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey."
"9015","Cramorant","This Cramorant has accidentally gotten a Pikachu lodged in its gullet. Cramorant is choking a little, but it isn’t really bothered."
"9016","Cramorant","The half-swallowed Pikachu is so startled that it isn’t struggling yet, but it’s still looking for a chance to strike back."
"9017","Cramorant","Cramorant’s gluttony led it to try to swallow an Arrokuda whole, which in turn led to Cramorant getting an Arrokuda stuck in its throat."
"9018","Cramorant","The slightest shock is sometimes enough to get this Pokémon to spit out the Arrokuda lodged in its throat."
"9019","Arrokuda","If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw."
"9020","Arrokuda","After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant swallows it up."
"9021","Arrokuda","Arrokuda can swim quickly only in a straight line. The ones that become sluggish from overeating are the first to be targeted by flocks of Wattrel."
"9022","Arrokuda","It takes down prey by charging into them with its hard, pointed jaw. But Arrokuda’s eyesight is poor, so this tactic has a low success rate."
"9023","Barraskewda","This Pokémon has a jaw that’s as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s flesh is surprisingly tasty, too."
"9024","Barraskewda","It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them."
"9025","Barraskewda","It spins its tail fins to leap from the water, then viciously bites down on Wingull flying close to the water’s surface."
"9026","Barraskewda","It swims at speeds of over 100 knots and battles fiercely with pods of Finizen over prey."
"9027","Toxel","It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows."
"9028","Toxel","It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis."
"9029","Toxel","It has no problem drinking dirty water. An organ inside Toxel’s body filters such water into a poisonous liquid that is harmless to Toxel."
"9030","Toxel","This selfish, attention-seeking Pokémon stores poison and electricity in two different sacs inside its body."
"9031","Toxtricity","When this Pokémon sounds as if it’s strumming a guitar, it’s actually clawing at the protrusions on its chest to generate electricity."
"9032","Toxtricity","This short-tempered and aggressive Pokémon chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it might contain."
"9033","Toxtricity","As it scatters toxic sweat and emits electricity, a melody that sounds like it came from a guitar reverberates through the surrounding area."
"9034","Toxtricity","The jolts of electricity it launches by violently strumming the protrusions on its chest easily exceed 15,000 volts."
"9035","Toxtricity","Capable of generating 15,000 volts of electricity, this Pokémon looks down on all that would challenge it."
"9036","Toxtricity","It has an electrical organ on its chest. While generating electricity, it fills its surroundings with what sounds like the strumming of a bass guitar."
"9037","Toxtricity","Many youths admire the way this Pokémon listlessly picks fights and keeps its cool no matter what opponent it faces."
"9038","Toxtricity","As it gulps down stagnant water and generates electricity in its body, a sound like a rhythm played by a bass guitar reverberates all around."
"9039","Toxtricity","Its excessive electric energy is its weapon. This Pokémon can build up more electricity than any thundercloud."
"9040","Toxtricity","Out of control after its own poison penetrated its brain, it tears across the land in a rampage, contaminating the earth with toxic sweat."
"9041","Sizzlipede","It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot."
"9042","Sizzlipede","It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel."
"9043","Centiskorch","When it heats up, its body temperature reaches about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its body like a whip and launches itself at enemies."
"9044","Centiskorch","While its burning body is already dangerous on its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has large and very sharp fangs."
"9045","Centiskorch","Gigantamax energy has evoked a rise in its body temperature, now reaching over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. Its heat waves incinerate its enemies."
"9046","Centiskorch","The heat that comes off a Gigantamax Centiskorch may destabilize air currents. Sometimes it can even cause storms."
"9047","Clobbopus","It’s very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land."
"9048","Clobbopus","Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old."
"9049","Grapploct","A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful."
"9050","Grapploct","Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea."
"9051","Sinistea","The swirl pattern in this Pokémon’s body is its weakness. If it gets stirred, the swirl loses its shape, and Sinistea gets dizzy."
"9052","Sinistea","It absorbs the life-force of those who drink it. It waits patiently, but opportunities are fleeting— it tastes so bad that it gets spat out immediately."
"9053","Sinistea","Some fanatics will go to great pains to prepare the perfect tea and teacup, eagerly waiting for a Sinistea to come and possess their selections."
"9054","Sinistea","This Sinistea lives in an antique teacup. As valuable as this Pokémon is, its awful taste remains unchanged."
"9055","Sinistea","This Pokémon is said to have been born when a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup of tea."
"9056","Sinistea","The teacup in which this Pokémon makes its home is a famous piece of antique tableware. Many forgeries are in circulation."
"9057","Sinistea","The soul of someone who died alone possessed some leftover tea. This Pokémon appears in hotels and houses."
"9058","Sinistea","Sinistea gets into your body when you drink it, and then it steals your vitality from within. It also tastes awful."
"9059","Polteageist","Trainers Polteageist trusts will be allowed to experience its distinctive flavor and aroma firsthand by sampling just a tiny bit of its tea."
"9060","Polteageist","When angered, it launches tea from its body at the offender’s mouth. The tea causes strong chills if swallowed."
"9061","Polteageist","Apparently a Polteageist’s disposition is affected by the type of tea the Pokémon came from. What teapot it inhabits makes no difference."
"9062","Polteageist","Though risky to drink, this Pokémon’s tea tastes delicious. Gourmets who have no fear of danger drink Polteageist tea day after day."
"9063","Polteageist","This species lives in antique teapots. Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions, an authentic work is found."
"9064","Polteageist","Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself into it, turning the tea into a new Polteageist."
"9065","Polteageist","The tea that composes Polteageist’s body has a distinct and enjoyable flavor. Drinking too much, however, can be fatal."
"9066","Polteageist","These Pokémon multiply by creeping into teapots and pouring themselves into leftover tea."
"9067","Hatenna","Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you."
"9068","Hatenna","If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas without people."
"9069","Hatenna","Because the emotions of others constantly flow into its head, this Pokémon prefers environments where no other creatures live."
"9070","Hatenna","It senses the feelings of other living creatures. Be careful not to expose it to strong emotions for too long, or it will end up exhausted."
"9071","Hattrem","No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence you violently."
"9072","Hattrem","Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to get them to quiet down. One blow from those braids would knock out a professional boxer."
"9073","Hattrem","To this Pokémon, strong emotions apparently feel like incredibly loud noises—even if the emotions are happy ones."
"9074","Hattrem","The moment this Pokémon finds someone who’s emitting strong emotions, it will pummel them senseless with its braids to silence them."
"9075","Hatterene","It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others."
"9076","Hatterene","If you’re too loud around it, you risk being torn apart by the claws on its tentacle. This Pokémon is also known as the Forest Witch."
"9077","Hatterene","Hatterene knocks out those that intrude in its home forest by blasting them with a beam, then slashing with claws enhanced by psychic power."
"9078","Hatterene","Beware of forests that show no signs of living creatures within. You may have wandered into Hatterene’s territory."
"9079","Hatterene","This Pokémon can read the emotions of creatures over 30 miles away. The minute it senses hostility, it goes on the attack."
"9080","Hatterene","Beams like lightning shoot down from its tentacles. It’s known to some as the Raging Goddess."
"9081","Impidimp","Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations produced by people and Pokémon when they feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy."
"9082","Impidimp","It sneaks into people’s homes, stealing things and feasting on the negative energy of the frustrated occupants."
"9083","Impidimp","The reason this Pokémon causes trouble for those it feels close to is because Impidimp itself gets irritable if it can’t absorb negative emotions."
"9084","Impidimp","They live in groups, pestering and playing pranks on each other to polish their troublemaking skills."
"9085","Morgrem","When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for forgiveness, it’s trying to lure opponents in so that it can stab them with its spear-like hair."
"9086","Morgrem","With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the woods. Some believe it to have the power to make crops grow."
"9087","Morgrem","Morgrem prefers dirty tactics, like ambushing, because it doesn’t have confidence in its brawn."
"9088","Morgrem","This Pokémon absorbs negative emotions and turns them into energy. It’s popular with people who tend to think gloomy thoughts."
"9089","Grimmsnarl","With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm even Machamp."
"9090","Grimmsnarl","Its hairs work like muscle fibers. When its hairs unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring them as tentacles would."
"9091","Grimmsnarl","This Pokémon has complete control over its hair. Grimmsnarl normally keeps its hair wrapped around its body to support its muscles."
"9092","Grimmsnarl","It lives deep within the forest. Even after evolving into this splendid form, it hasn’t given up on its petty misdeeds and pranks."
"9093","Grimmsnarl","By transforming its leg hair, this Pokémon delivers power-packed drill kicks that can bore huge holes in Galar’s terrain."
"9094","Grimmsnarl","Gigantamax energy has caused more hair to sprout all over its body. With the added strength, it can jump over the world’s tallest building."
"9095","Obstagoon","Its voice is staggering in volume. Obstagoon has a tendency to take on a threatening posture and shout—this move is known as Obstruct."
"9096","Obstagoon","It evolved after experiencing numerous fights. While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that would make any opponent flinch."
"9097","Perrserker","What appears to be an iron helmet is actually hardened hair. This Pokémon lives for the thrill of battle."
"9098","Perrserker","After many battles, it evolved dangerous claws that come together to form daggers when extended."
"9099","Cursola","Its shell is overflowing with its heightened otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as protection for this Pokémon’s core spirit."
"9100","Cursola","Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul. You’ll become stiff as stone if you touch it."
"9101","Sirfetch'd","Only Farfetch’d that have survived many battles can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s leek withers, it will retire from combat."
"9102","Sirfetch'd","After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food."
"9103","Mr. Rime","It’s highly skilled at tap-dancing. It waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements."
"9104","Mr. Rime","Its amusing movements make it very popular. It releases its psychic power from the pattern on its belly."
"9105","Runerigus","A powerful curse was woven into an ancient painting. After absorbing the spirit of a Yamask, the painting began to move."
"9106","Runerigus","Never touch its shadowlike body, or you’ll be shown the horrific memories behind the picture carved into it."
"9107","Milcery","This Pokémon was born from sweet-smelling particles in the air. Its body is made of cream."
"9108","Milcery","They say that any patisserie visited by Milcery is guaranteed success and good fortune."
"9109","Alcremie","The moment it evolved, it took on a bitter flavor. This is because of the way its cells spontaneously shifted during evolution."
"9110","Alcremie","The cells that compose its cream fluctuated suddenly during evolution, giving the cream a bitter flavor."
"9111","Alcremie","Cream pours endlessly from this Pokémon’s body. The cream stiffens when compressed by an impact. A harder impact results in harder cream."

"9113","Alcremie","When it trusts a Trainer, it will treat them to berries it’s decorated with cream."
"9114","Alcremie","When Alcremie is content, the cream it secretes from its hands becomes sweeter and richer."
"9115","Alcremie","The moment it evolved, it took on a sour flavor. This is because of the way its cells spontaneously shifted during evolution."
"9116","Alcremie","The cells that compose its cream fluctuated suddenly during evolution, giving the cream a sour flavor."
"9117","Alcremie","The moment it evolved, it took on an aromatic flavor. This is because of the way its cells spontaneously shifted during evolution."

"9131","Falinks","The brass, which is the one that stands at the front and issues orders, is the strongest and smartest of the six."
"9132","Falinks","The leader, known as the brass, uses its extendible horn to issue orders to the others when it’s time to change formation."
"9133","Pincurchin","It feeds on seaweed, using its teeth to scrape it off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of its spines."
"9134","Pincurchin","It stores electricity in each spine. Even if one gets broken off, it still continues to emit electricity for at least three hours."
"9135","Pincurchin","This Pokémon generates electricity when it digests food. It uses its five hard teeth to scrape seaweed off surfaces and eat it."
"9136","Pincurchin","This Pokémon is so timid that even brushing against seaweed will make it discharge electricity in surprise. Its lips do not conduct electricity."
"9137","Snom","It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps."
"9138","Snom","It eats snow that piles up on the ground. The more snow it eats, the bigger and more impressive the spikes on its back grow."
"9139","Snom","It eats snow that has accumulated on the ground. It prefers soft, freshly fallen snow, so it will eat its way up a mountain, aiming for the peak."
"9140","Snom","Within its internal organs, Snom amplifies the frigid air it gets from eating snow and then uses this amplified air to create icicle-like spikes."
"9141","Frosmoth","Icy scales fall from its wings like snow as it flies over fields and mountains. The temperature of its wings is less than −290 degrees Fahrenheit."
"9142","Frosmoth","It shows no mercy to any who desecrate fields and mountains. It will fly around on its icy wings, causing a blizzard to chase offenders away."

"9144","Frosmoth","It causes blizzards as it flies around with its huge, chill-emanating wings. Clean meltwater is its favorite thing to drink."
"9145","Stonjourner","It stands in grasslands, watching the sun’s descent from zenith to horizon. This Pokémon has a talent for delivering dynamic kicks."
"9146","Stonjourner","Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in a circle."
"9147","Stonjourner","The elemental composition of the rocks that form its body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from this Pokémon’s habitat."

"9149","Eiscue","It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold."
"9150","Eiscue","This Pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single hair into the sea to lure in prey."
"9151","Eiscue","On hot days, these Pokémon press their ice cube heads together and pass the time cooling each other down."

"9154","Eiscue","The hair on its head connects to the surface of its brain. When this Pokémon has something on its mind, its hair chills the air around it."

"9164","Indeedee","In search of happy feelings—such as joy and gratitude—Indeedee bustles around, taking diligent care of people and other Pokémon."
"9165","Morpeko","As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity."

"9171","Cufant","Using the pointy tip of its trunk, it carves off chunks of hard rocks to eat. It is very docile and helps people with physical labor."
"9172","Cufant","Cufant can lift loads weighing five tons. In the mornings, it heads into caves with its herd, in search of the ore on which these Pokémon feed."

"9174","Copperajah","These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush giant rocks into powder."
"9175","Copperajah","This Pokémon was brought to Paldea long ago by people from a faraway land. It’s so strong that it can easily pull an airplane."
"9176","Copperajah","Copperajah are prideful, cantankerous Pokémon. Specimens with vibrant green skin command the respect of others of their kind."
"9177","Copperajah","So much power is packed within its trunk that if it were to unleash that power, the resulting blast could level mountains and change the landscape."
"9178","Copperajah","After this Pokémon has Gigantamaxed, its massive nose can utterly demolish large structures with a single smashing blow."
"9179","Dracozolt","In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources."
"9180","Dracozolt","The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small."
"9181","Arctozolt","The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around."
"9182","Arctozolt","This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly."
"9183","Dracovish","Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction."
"9184","Dracovish","Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon can’t breathe unless it’s underwater."
"9185","Arctovish","Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head."
"9186","Arctovish","The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go extinct anyway."
"9187","Duraludon","Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily."
"9188","Duraludon","The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain."
"9189","Duraludon","It’s grown to resemble a skyscraper. Parts of its towering body glow due to a profusion of energy."
"9190","Duraludon","The hardness of its cells is exceptional, even among Steel types. It also has a body structure that’s resistant to earthquakes."
"9191","Dreepy","After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas."

"9195","Drakloak","It’s capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve."
"9196","Drakloak","Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy."
"9197","Drakloak","This Pokémon flies around at over 120 miles per hour. If a Drakloak is defeated in a battle, its Dreepy will wander off without a second thought."

"9199","Dragapult","When it isn’t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles."
"9200","Dragapult","Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds."
"9201","Dragapult","Dragapult can make its whole body transparent by clearing its mind and focusing. Even the Dreepy in Dragapult’s horns become invisible."
"9202","Dragapult","The fastest Dragapult of the group is always surrounded by Dreepy that want to fly at sonic speed."
"9203","Zacian","Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle."
"9204","Zacian","This Pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister—others say the two Pokémon are rivals."
"9205","Zacian","Now armed with a weapon it used in ancient times, this Pokémon needs only a single strike to fell even Gigantamax Pokémon."
"9206","Zacian","Able to cut down anything with a single strike, it became known as the Fairy King’s Sword, and it inspired awe in friend and foe alike."
"9207","Zamazenta","In times past, it worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs metal that it then uses in battle."
"9208","Zamazenta","This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot that it ever existed."
"9209","Zamazenta","Its ability to deflect any attack led to it being known as the Fighting Master’s Shield. It was feared and respected by all."
"9210","Zamazenta","Now that it’s equipped with its shield, it can shrug off impressive blows, including the attacks of Dynamax Pokémon."
"9211","Eternatus","The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active."
"9212","Eternatus","It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon."
"9213","Eternatus","As a result of Rose’s meddling, Eternatus absorbed all the energy in the Galar region. It’s now in a state of power overload."
"9214","Eternatus","Infinite amounts of energy pour from this Pokémon’s enlarged core, warping the surrounding space-time."
"9215","Kubfu","Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves."
"9216","Kubfu","If Kubfu pulls the long white hair on its head, its fighting spirit heightens and power wells up from the depths of its belly."
"9217","Urshifu","People call it the embodiment of rage. It’s said that this Pokémon’s terrifying expression and shout will rid the world of malevolence."

"9220","Urshifu","Inhabiting the mountains of a distant region, this Pokémon races across sheer cliffs, training its legs and refining its moves."
"9221","Urshifu","As it waits for the right moment to unleash its Gigantamax power, this Pokémon maintains a perfect one-legged stance. It won’t even twitch."
"9222","Urshifu","All it takes is a glare from this Pokémon to take the lives of those with evil in their hearts—or so they say."
"9223","Urshifu","It’s believed that this Pokémon modeled its fighting style on the flow of a river—sometimes rapid, sometimes calm."
"9224","Urshifu","This form of Urshifu is a strong believer in defeating foes by raining many blows down on them. Its strikes are nonstop, flowing like a river."
"9225","Zarude","Within dense forests, this Pokémon lives in a pack with others of its kind. It’s incredibly aggressive, and the other Pokémon of the forest fear it."
"9226","Zarude","Once the vines on Zarude’s body tear off, they become nutrients in the soil. This helps the plants of the forest grow."
"9227","Zarude","This Zarude left its pack to raise a human child. The cloth Zarude would wrap the child with has a comforting scent that calmed the child’s crying."
"9228","Zarude","This Zarude’s special strength stems from its love and care for an orphaned human child that the Pokémon has raised since the child’s infancy."
"9229","Regieleki","This Pokémon is a cluster of electrical energy. It’s said that removing the rings on Regieleki’s body will unleash the Pokémon’s latent power."

"9231","Regidrago","An academic theory proposes that Regidrago’s arms were once the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon. The theory remains unproven."
"9232","Regidrago","Its body is composed of crystallized dragon energy. Regidrago is said to have the powers of every dragon Pokémon."
"9233","Glastrier","Glastrier emits intense cold from its hooves. It’s also a belligerent Pokémon—anything it wants, it takes by force."

"9235","Spectrier","It probes its surroundings with all its senses save one—it doesn’t use its sense of sight. Spectrier’s kicks are said to separate soul from body."
"9236","Spectrier","As it dashes through the night, Spectrier absorbs the life-force of sleeping creatures. It craves silence and solitude."
"9237","Calyrex","Calyrex is a merciful Pokémon, capable of providing healing and blessings. It reigned over the Galar region in times of yore."

"9244","Kleavor","A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes and shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon this Pokémon in the wilds, one’s only recourse is to flee."
"9245","Ursaluna","I believe it was Hisui’s swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat at will."
"9246","Basculegion","Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before fulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species throughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal."
"9247","Sneasler","Because of Sneasler’s virulent poison and daunting physical prowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen highlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs."

"9257","Fuecoco","It lies on warm rocks and uses the heat absorbed by its square-shaped scales to create fire energy."
"9258","Fuecoco","Its flame sac is small, so energy is always leaking out. This energy is released from the dent atop Fuecoco’s head and flickers to and fro."
"9259","Crocalor","The combination of Crocalor’s fire energy and overflowing vitality has caused an egg-shaped fireball to appear on the Pokémon’s head."

"9332","Kilowattrel","It uses its throat sac to store electricity generated by its wings. There’s hardly any oil in its feathers, so it is a poor swimmer."
"9333","Maschiff","It always scowls in an attempt to make opponents take it seriously, but even crying children will burst into laughter when they see Maschiff’s face."
"9334","Maschiff","Its well-developed jaw and fangs are strong enough to crunch through boulders, and its thick fat makes for an excellent defense."

"9356","Rellor","It rolls its mud ball around while the energy it needs for evolution matures. Eventually the time comes for it to evolve."
"9357","Rabsca","The body that supports the ball barely moves. Therefore, it is thought that the true body of this Pokémon is actually inside the ball."
